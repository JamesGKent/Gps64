# Gps64
GPS Calculations for Arduino

I have been always frustrated from the missing double (64bit) type in Arduino world and hence the problem with properly calculating GPS distance, bearing and destination point.

This library uses Float64 & Math64 libs and also adds some fast and very fast implementations of trigonometric functions and fast and regular versions of GPS distance, bearing and destination point.
